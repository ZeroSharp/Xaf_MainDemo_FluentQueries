## Example of fluent queries with DevExpress XPO ##

[DevExpress XPO](http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/ORM/) supports various syntaxes for querying data.

The goal of this project is to provide an example of a fluent interface interface for querying the data in the MainDemo sample. The same method can be adapted for use with any XPO data.

### Dependencies ###

Requires [DevExpress Xaf](http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/Application_Framework/). This currently uses version 13.1.5.
